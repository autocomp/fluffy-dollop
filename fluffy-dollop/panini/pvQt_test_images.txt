
This is a collection of images for testing pvQt, or any panorama viewer.
All are versions of the same spherical panorama, a view of the officers'
saloon on Philadelphia's tall ship Gazela (you can learn more about her 
at http://gazela.org/ships/gazela/gazela.htm).

The file name indicates the projection, and in some cases the vertical 
field of view in degrees (some of which exceed the maximum vFov that
pvQt can display).  Most images are 360 degrees wide.

All stitching and most reprojection was done with PTGui version 8.02.
The stereographic projection was made with hugin 0.7.0.  Cube faces 
and qtvrs were made with Pano2VR 2.0.2.  The cube faces and cubic qtvr 
are from a high resolution hdr stitch; all others are from ldr stitches.  

Let me know if anything looks wrong (tksharpless@gmail.com).
